## Instructions
* Click on a card
* Keep revealing cards and working your memory to remember each unveiled card.
* Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time

##Explaining the code
let card = document.getElementsByClassName("card");
let cards = [...card];
console.log(cards);
The code above is a representation of the javascript file, to be precise, the beginning of the algorithm.
My algorithm helped me get the cards as well as let them shuffle, get them to match, count the moves,get star rating and a timer as well.

## Built with
